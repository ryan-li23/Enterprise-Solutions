The music was composed by Calixa Lavallée, and the French lyrics were written by Adolphe-Basile Routhier.

It was proclaimed the official <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> on July 1, 1980. “God Save the Queen” remains the royal <b>anthem</b> of <b>Canada</b>. &quot; O <b>Canada</b> &quot; ( French: Ô <b>Canada</b>) is the <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> of <b>Canada</b>. The song was originally commissioned by Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Théodore Robitaille for the 1880 Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony; Calixa Lavallée composed the music, after which French-language words were written by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. God keep our land glorious and free! <b>Canada</b>, we stand on guard for thee. <b>Canada</b>, we stand on guard for thee. <b>Canada</b> OUR <b>NATIONAL ANTHEM</b> (English version) <b>Canada</b>! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all of us command. With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free! From far and wide, “O <b>Canada</b>” was approved as <b>Canada</b>’s <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> by a Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on 15 March 1967. It was officially adopted as <b>Canada</b>’s <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> under the <b>National</b> <b>Anthem</b> Act on 27 June 1980. The Act was proclaimed by Governor General Edward Schreyer in a public ceremony on Parliament Hill on 1 July 1980. Composer Calixa Lavallée is one of the most important Canadians you&#39;ve never heard of. We all know the feeling. An unexpected constriction in the throat. Heat rising to the face. Tears welling in the corner of our eyes. We’re responding to “O <b>Canada</b>.” Calixa Lavallée, known as “<b>Canada</b>’s <b>national</b> musician”, was asked to compose the music for a poem written by Adolphe-Basile Routhier. As intended, the first performance of “O <b>Canada</b>” took place on June 24, 1880, at a banquet held at the Pavillon des Patineurs in the City of Québec. 2023-10-05 Get information about the melodies, objects and flags that have become – through traditional usage or by public perception – the symbols by which<b> Canadians</b> identify themselves.\u001b[0m\n",
